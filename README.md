# Libft

**Libft** is a custom library implemented in C as part of a programming project. It aims to recreate essential standard library functions and introduce additional utility functions for future use in C programming. 

This library serves as a foundational toolkit for efficient and reusable code in subsequent projects.

## Features

### Mandatory Part
- Reimplementation of essential C standard library functions (e.g., `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_strjoin`).
- Compliance with rigorous coding standards, ensuring no memory leaks and robust error handling.
- A static library `libft.a` for easy integration into other projects.

### Bonus Part
- Advanced functions for linked list management, such as `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_back`, and `ft_lstmap`.

## Technical Requirements
- Written entirely in C.
- Uses a custom Makefile to compile the library with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` flags.
- Avoids global variables and adheres strictly to the Norm coding style.

## Usage
- Compile the library by running `make` in the root directory.
- Include the `libft.h` header in your C project to access the library functions.

## Why Libft?
Building **Libft** helps deepen understanding of core C concepts and enhances problem-solving skills. Itâ€™s not just a learning exercise but also a reliable companion for more complex projects.
